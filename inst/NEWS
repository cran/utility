Modification history of utility package
=======================================


Changes version 1.4.2 (15.11.2017) -> version 1.4.3 (27.09.2018)
================================================================

PR: allow for NAs and set them equal to "" for attributes in endnode.cond

PR: new plot arguments "col.val" and "lwd.val" for formatting the value lines
    in hierarchy and table boxes

PR: constant extrapolation added to intpol1d node; plot bounded to data 
    range
    xlim added to plot.utility.endnode.intpol1d and 
    plot.utility.endnode.parfun1d
    xlim and ylim added to plot.utility.endnode.intpol2d

PR: New function implemented: "utility.get.attrib.names"


Changes version 1.4.1 (09.05.2017) -> version 1.4.2 (15.11.2017)
================================================================

PR: Error corrected with plotting hierarchies: the argument "two.lines" was 
    ignored if the hierarchy was plotted from a node other than the top node
    
PR: Format of hierarchy and table plots adjusted by not setting margins to 
    zero internally.
    This leaves the user the freedom of chosing his or her own margins


Changes version 1.4 (15.01.2017) -> version 1.4.1 (09.05.2017)
==============================================================

PR: Error corrected with plotting aggregation functions that use the 
    argument "add.arg.fun"
    ("evaluate" correctly used the argument already in version 1.4)


Changes version 1.3 (14.10.2014) -> version 1.4 (15.01.2017)
============================================================

PR: New aggregation technique "bonusmalus" added

PR: Documentation of aggregation functions complemented with equations and 
    plots

PR: New aggregation techniques "addpower", "revaddpower", "addsplitpower", 
    "revaddsplitpower" added
    
PR: Width of colored axes in 2d aggregation countour plot increased

PR: Position of legend in hierarchy plot improved (level of lowest box)

PR: Colors of boundary values modified to get color corresponding to higher 
    values

PR: New option "two.lines"" for plotting hierarchies with spreading the 
    labels in the boxes across two lines

PR: New end node type "classcounts" implemented


Changes version 1.2 (15.01.2014) -> version 1.3 (14.10.2014)
============================================================

PR: New end node type "firstavail" implemented

PR: Error corrected: argument "with.attrib=FALSE" was ignored in hierarchical 
    plot when nodes were specified

PR: Error in hierarchical view with multiple u and a single uref corrected.

PR: New aggregation function provided:
      "utility.aggregate.addmin"

PR: Missing offset parameter added to example in help file for the functions
    utility.aggregate.geooff, utility.aggregate.revgeooff, 
    utility.aggregate.harmooff, utility.aggregate.revharmooff, 

PR: Change attribute type to numeric for endnodes intpol1d, intpol2d and 
    parfun1d

PR: Bounding boxes corrected for tabular plot

PR: Comment added to example regarding values out of range due to normal
    distribution of uncertainty.

PR: Line ends improved for color legend in hierarchy plot.

PR: Additional argument "print.val" added to the plot functions for tables
    and hierarchies to select whether the numerical values should be written 
    into the boxes in the tabular view.


Changes version 1.1 (03.03.2013) -> version 1.2 (15.01.2014)
============================================================

PR: Citation file added and reference updated.

PR: Plot of aggregation nodes as isolines if only two nodes are aggregated

PR: Colored bars along axes of value functions improved according to plots
    of 2d aggregation nodes (see point above)

PR: Function "utility.structure":
    Missing consideration of shift.levels for end nodes corrected.
    Function "utility.structure" is now exported.

PR: The functions 
      "updatepar.utility.conversion.intpol" and 
      "updatepar.utility.conversion.parfun"
    are corrected to update parameters of underlying nodes.

PR: New aggregation functions provided:
      "utility.aggregate.geo"
      "utility.aggregate.geooff"
      "utility.aggregate.revgeo"
      "utility.aggregate.revgeooff"
      "utility.aggregate.harmo"
      "utility.aggregate.harmooff"
      "utility.aggregate.revharmo"
      "utility.aggregate.revharmooff"

PR: New argument "levels" in plot functions to indicate which hierarchical
    levels should be plotted in hierarchical and tabular plots.

PR: New argument "plot.val" in plot functions to indicate whether a vertical 
    line indicating the value should be plotted in the boxes of hierarchical 
    and tabular plots.

PR: New option to provide u as a list in plot functions with option type =
    "table" or type = "hierarchy" to plot multiple rows or hierarchies with 
    uncertainty ranges.

PR: Argument "uref" is now also supported for type="table".

PR: Output of class constructors on successful termination suppressed.


Changes version 1.0 (22.09.2012) -> version 1.1 (03.03.2013)
============================================================

PR: Functions "updatepar" and "utility.get.colors" are now exported.

PR: Global variable "utility.num.colors" eliminated.

PR: Documentation of plotting hierarchies complemented by the comment that
    only value nodes are colored.
